Eventfd Binding
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsgf/eventfd-rust.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsgf/eventfd-rust)

This crate implements a binding for eventfd. This isn't especially
useful on its own; the primary use case is as part of the API for
other Linux syscalls and subsystems.
